Welcome to PyQuadrants!  This game is intended to run in the Code Institute mock terminal in Heroku.  As far as I know, I invented this game (though it started out based off of the Gigamic game 'Quantik' and morphed into something totally different).  In this game, players will compete against the computer to gain control over rows, columns, or quadrants.  The instructions are as follows:

### PyQuadrants Instructions

Instructions:

-The game board has four rows, four columns, and four quadrants.

-Rows are the horizontal lines, numbered from left to right.  

-Columns are the vertical lines, numbered from top to bottom.

-Quadrants are the four colored regions.

-The Player's game piece is X, and the Computer's is Y.

-Players take turns placing their respective game pieces on the board.

-The goal is to gain control of as many rows, columns, and quadrants as possible.

-Control is established when a player's game pieces fill at least three of the four available spaces on a row, column, or quadrant.

-Players continue taking turns placing their respective game pieces on the board until there are no more available spaces.

-When there are no more available spaces remaining on the game board, then the game is over, and the player with the most points wins.

Scoring:

-Control is when three of four available spaces on a row, column, or quadrant are represented by one player.  
Control = 1 point

-Complete Control is when all four available spaces of a row, column, or quadrant are represented by one player.
Complete Control = 3 points

Good Luck!
